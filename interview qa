Normalization and standardization are two techniques used to transform data into a common scale. Normalization is a technique used to scale numerical data in the range of 0 to 1. This technique is useful when the distribution of the data is not known or when the data is not normally distributed. On the other hand, standardization is a technique used to transform data into a standard normal distribution. This technique is useful when the distribution of the data is known and when the data is normally distributed. Both techniques have different applications, and choosing the right technique based on the data and the problem you're trying to solve is important.
