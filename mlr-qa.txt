1.What is Normalization & Standardization and how is it helpful?
Normalization and standardization are two techniques used to transform data into a common scale. Normalization is a technique used to scale numerical data in the range of 0 to 1. This technique is useful when the distribution of the data is not known or when the data is not normally distributed. On the other hand, standardization is a technique used to transform data into a standard normal distribution. This technique is useful when the distribution of the data is known and when the data is normally distributed. Both techniques have different applications, and choosing the right technique based on the data and the problem you're trying to solve is important.


2.What techniques can be used to address multicollinearity in multiple linear regression?
To address multicollinearity, techniques such as regularization or feature selection can be applied to select a subset of independent variables that are not highly correlated with each other. In this article, we will focus on the most common one â€“ VIF (Variance Inflation Factors)
